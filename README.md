# 🚀 Space Burger 
A modern React + TypeScript application for building and ordering custom space-themed burgers.
This project demonstrates advanced frontend development techniques including dynamic UI composition, real-time WebSocket data, and clean architectural patterns using Redux Toolkit.  
Users can drag-and-drop ingredients to build their custom burger, view live order feeds and oreder history. This project mimics a production-level frontend architecture and is built with scalability and testability in mind.
